# Capstone-3D
Just a short description here, this is the capstone project I did in the Fall of 2017. It consists of two seperate game test environments. One where you are a block tank that can shoot portals to use to teleport around the place and if the code is active you can also switch over to controlling a mech. At the state that it was in when my Capstone ended there was no particular objectives, maybe one day I'll go back and create some proper levels to explore. The second game is a bit more completed, it's a real time board based game where you can summon a few characters and move them around on the map as they auto attack the enemies and then you can also use their skills as they become available. It's a bit buggy but was working decently enough to demonstrate the core idea of what I would make if I fully implemented it.
